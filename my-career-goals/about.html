      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Chloe Tega Agbah, I am from Delta State, Nigeria.I am building this site to track my career aspirations and the steps I take to reach them.  </p>

      <h2>Background & Interests</h2>
      <p>I am interested in women's health and reproductive rights, which has inspired me to pursue a career in Gynaecology. I also enjoy coding and web development, as it allows me to express my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>

      <h2>Why I chose this career</h2>
      <p> I am about to study Gynaecology and be a very good gynaecologist that helps women and help solve fertility issues in women. I am currently studying web development and want to pursue a professional role in software engineering, The reason why i am choosing this career paths is because I want to make a difference in the lives of women and help them achieve their reproductive health goals. Most women who doesn't have children or have fertility issues face a lot of challenges and stigma in society, and I want to be there to support them through their journey, I want to ease them of the burden and pain. I know this career paths won't be an easy journey, but I am ready to face any challenges that comes with it, and I know my Heavenly Father in Heaven will guide me and help me achive my dreams.</p>
